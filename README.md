## Environment
This notebook can be ran in either a VSCode (locally) or Google Colab like virtual environment.

## How to run
Clone and open this repository in VSCode.
Change the path of the video footage inside the code where you would see this line of code:
`video_path = 'input_video.MP4'`

You can also change the output directory:
`output_dir = 'raw_frames_output'`

Otherwise default will save the frames on root repository directory.

Finally run the code block by block from VSCode.
